# The-Gaming-Room

#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

# The client wanted a web-based application that could run on multiple platforms. They wanted their game to have unique teams with unique players that would be able to guess a loading picture that would unblur over the span of 30 seconds and the first to guess correctly gets a point. The client was The Gaming Room which was a game studio. 

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

# I think i did the UML design the best showing what parts inherit from where which is important. This is important to help guide the coding process and also a good way to lay out the code.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

# I also think the UML design was the most helpful part of the design document. This again is a perfect way to show how the game will be written and which objects inherit from other ones. I think for the client the best part would be the constraints becuase it will address issues that the developers will run into and could change the cost of developing their application and the time it will take.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

# I would probably revise the reccomendations section and that would be as I actually start to develop applications I will understand better on what to reccomend and what I would prefer. I think it will just be apart of the learning process after starting to develop and getting those preferences.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

# It is very imporant to understand the users needs and really asking important questions. This is important as a business practice due to cutting down on revisng code to fit their needs better as you start to show them the initial product. If you understand the clients needs you can develop the application more effiecently by doing what they want and being able to produce it. It is also a good place to reccomend things that would help their application out that they might now know about.

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

# I used all the resources available to me. I used the REST-style API which helped me define the interaction between the server and client-side and supports many platforms which was required for the application we were making. I also used the UMl that was provided to us to understand how to develope the classes and which ones were the parent classes and how to set those up to be used. I also had to go back to previous projects to refresh myself how to make certain parts of the code like making a team of people and making sure they are unique objects which was helpful.
